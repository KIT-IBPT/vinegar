Welcome to Vinegar Boot's documentation!
========================================

If you are new to Vinegar, you might want to start with the
:ref:`introduction` and then continue with
`Getting Started <getting_started/index.html>`_ and `Concepts <concepts/index.html>`_.

As an experienced user, you will probably find the `API reference <api/index.html>`_
most useful. That reference does not just document the API (e.g. for writing)
extensions, but also gives a detailed specification of the configuration options
supported by the various components.
