Welcome to Vinegar Boot's documentation!
========================================

If you are new to Vinegar, you might want to start with the
:ref:`introduction` and then continue with
:ref:`getting_started` and :ref:`concepts`.

As an experienced user, you will probably find the :ref:`api` 
most useful. That reference does not just document the API (e.g. for writing)
extensions, but also gives a detailed specification of the configuration options
supported by the various components.

When upgrading from an older version of Vinegar, please be sure to check the
:ref:`release_notes`.
