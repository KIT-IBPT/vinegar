Vinegar 2.1
===========

When upgrading from Vinegar 1.x to Vinegar 2.x, there are a number of breaking
changes, so please be sure to read the release notes for
:ref:`release_notes_vinegar_2.0` as well.

When upgrading from Vinegar 2.0 to 2.1, no special precautions have to be
taken. As long as you do not modify the configuration, Vinegar 2.1 will behave
exactly like Vinegar 2.0.

If you want, you can use the new ``provide_python_modules`` option that is now
supported by the `vinegar.template.jinja` module. Please refer to the module
documentation for details
