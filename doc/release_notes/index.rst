Vinegar uses semantic versioning. This means that upgrades keeping the major
version (e.g. from 1.0.0 to 1.2.0) can be done without any special
considerations. Everything that worked before should still be working. However,
you might still want to read the release notes in order to learn about new
features that might have been added or bugs that might have been fixed.

When upgrading to a new major version (e.g. from 1.x.x to 2.x.x), you should
check the release notes of the new version for information about incompatible
changes that have been introduced. Such changes might impact the API, the
configuration format, or the behavior of the application. When skipping a major
version during an upgrade, (e.g. directly upgrading from 1.x.x to 3.x.x),
please be sure to also check all sections for the versions that you are
skipping, because they might contain important information as well.

As the documentation only includes release notes for the most recent major
release, you will have to refer to the relevant older versions of the
documentation in that case. In the example mentioned above, you would have to
check the documentation of version 2.x.x for the release notes associated with
this version when upgrading from 1.x.x to 3.x.x.
