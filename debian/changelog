vinegar (2.0.0) stable; urgency=low

  Vinegar 2.0 is a major feature release that introduces some changes that are
  not fully compatible with earlier releases.

  Changes include but are not limited to:

  * Compatibility with Jinja 3.x (in addition to 2.x).
  * New module vinegar.transform.ip_address.
  * Support for additional access restrictions in request handlers.
  * More information available when rendering templates.
  * Significantly enhanced matching syntax in the YAML-target data source.
  * Many minor bugfixes and additional improvements.

  Some of these changes necessitated changes to the API, so please be sure to
  check the release notes in the documentation before migrating to this release.

  Vinegar now only runs with Python 3.8 or later.

vinegar (1.2.0) stable; urgency=low

  * Added support for the HTTP content length header. A content length
    is now provided for HTTP responses when serving static content of
    known length. For generated content, this header might still be
    missing because the content length might not be known yet when
    sending the headers.
