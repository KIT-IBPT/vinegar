"""
Base package for transformation functions.

Transformation functions are functions that help with transforming a value,
possibly building a chain.

For a list of the supported functions, please refer to the various sub-modules
that provide the actual functions. The functions from these modules can be
called directly.

The `apply_transformation` function in this module helps with calling
transformation functions that are not known at the time of writing the code.
For example, code might allow a user to choose the transformation function at
runtime.

The `apply_transformation_chain` function can be used when a user can specify a
whole chain of transformations that shall be applied one after the other. If
that chain is going to be used repeatedly, it might be more efficient to use
`get_transformation_chain` once and use the returned function repeatedly.

    Transform a value using the specified transformation.

    The name of the transformation function that shall be used is specified in

    of one of the modules in the ``vinegar.transform`` package and
    ``function_name`` is the name of the transformation function in that
    module.

    Typically, transformation functions take the value to be transformed as
    their first positional argument.

    Example::

        apply_transformation('string.to_upper', 'abc')

        name of the transformation that shall be applied.

    Apply a chain of transformations to a value.

    Each of the functions in the chain in the chain is applied to the input
    value in sequence.

    The ``chain`` argument is a list of transformation specifications. Each
    specification is either a ``str`` simply specifying the name of the
    transformation function, or it is a ``dict`` with a single entry, where the
    key is the name of the transformation function and the value is the
    configuration for that function.

    The name of the transformation function is parsed according to the same
    as for the `apply_transformation` function.

    The configuration for a function can be a ``dict``, a ``list`` or another
    value. If it is a ``dict``, the items in it are passed to the function as
    keyword arguments. If it is a ``list``, the items in it are passed to the
    function as positional arguments (after the ``value`` argument). In all
    other cases, the configuration is passed as a single positional argument
    after the ``value`` argument.

        # The following three calls all result in the output "ABC.def":

            'string.to_upper',
