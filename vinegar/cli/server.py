"""
Vinegar server daemon.

If executed as a Python script, this module starts a Vinegar server, looking
for a configuration file in ``/etc/vinegar/vinegar-server.yaml``.

The path to the configuration file can be overridden through the
``--config-file`` command line argument.

Instead of executing this module as a script, it can be imported and its
`run_server` function can be used to start the server. In this case, the
configuration is expected to be passed to `run_server` in the form of a
dictionary.

The configuration file uses the YAML syntax and has the following keys (all of
them are optional):

:``data_sources``:
    List of data sources. Each item in the list must be a dictionary. This
    dictionary must have a key ``name`` that specifies the type of the data
    source. Please refer to the documentation of
    `vinegar.data_source.get_data_source` to learn more about how the name is
    resolved. All other keys are used for the configuration dictionary that is
    passed to the data source. It is perfectly legal to use multiple data
    sources with the same name, but having a different configuration. Please
    refer to the documentation of the data sources to learn more about the
    configuration options for each data sources. The resulting list of data
    sources is passed to `~vinegar.data_source.get_composite_datasource` in
    order to create a single data source that combines them all. The behavior
    of the compositve data source is also controlled by the
    ``data_sources_merge_lists`` option.

:``data_sources_merge_lists``:
    Flag controlling the behavior of the composite data source that is created
    for the list of ``data_sources``. The composite data source merges the data
    returned by each data source with the data from the previous data sources.
    This happens by merging mappings, preserving keys that are present in the
    previous data, but not in the data from the next data source. This process
    also applies to nested mappings. If ``data_sources_merge_lists`` is set to
    ``True``, sequences are also merged, meaning that elements that are not
    present in the list in the previous data are added to the list. If
    ``False`` (the default), sequences replace each other, removing all
    elements that were only present in the previous data.

:``data_sources_merge_sets``:
    Flag controlling the behavior of the composite data source that is created
    for the list of ``data_sources``. The composite data source merges the data
    returned by each data source with the data from the previous data sources.
    This happens by merging mappings, preserving keys that are present in the
    previous data, but not in the data from the next data source. This process
    also applies to nested mappings. If ``data_sources_merge_sets`` is set to
    ``True`` (the default), sets are also merged, meaning that the resulting
    set is the union of the set in the previous data and the set returned by
    the data source. If ``False``, sets replace each other, removing all
    elements that were only present in the previous data.

:``http``:
    Dictionary of configuration options for the HTTP server. The options are
    passed on to `vinegar.server.http.create_http_server`. The only exception
    is the ``request_handlers`` option. That option expects a list, where each
    item is a dictionary. This dictionary must have a key ``name`` that
    specifies the type of the request handler. Please refer to the
    documentation of `vinegar.request_handler.get_http_request_handler` to
    learn more about how the name is resolved. All other keys are used for the
    configuration dictionary that is passed to the request handler. It is
    perfectly legal to use multiple request handlers with the same name, but
    having a different configuration. Please refer to the documentation of the
    request handlers to learn more about the configuration options for each
    request handler.

:``logging_config_file``:
    Path to a logging configuration file. This file must be in the
    `format <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-fileformat>`_
    expected by ``logging.config.fileConfig``. This configuration option cannot
    be used together with the ``logging_level`` option.

:``logging_level``:
    Logging level to be used. Can be one of ``CRITICAL``, ``ERROR``, ``WARN``,
    ``INFO`` (the default), or ``DEBUG``. This configuration option cannot be
    used together with the ``logging_config_file`` option.

:``tftp``:
    Dictionary of configuration options for the TFTP server. The options are
    passed on to `vinegar.server.tftp.create_tftp_server`. The only exception
    is the ``request_handlers`` option. That option expects a list, where each
    item is a dictionary. This dictionary must have a key ``name`` that
    specifies the type of the request handler. Please refer to the
    documentation of `vinegar.request_handler.get_tftp_request_handler` to
    learn more about how the name is resolved. All other keys are used for the
    configuration dictionary that is passed to the request handler. It is
    perfectly legal to use multiple request handlers with the same name, but
    having a different configuration. Please refer to the documentation of the
    request handlers to learn more about the configuration options for each
    request handler.
