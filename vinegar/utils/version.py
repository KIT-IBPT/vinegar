"""
Utility functions for calculating version strings.

Version strings provide a simple tool for finding out whether a specific
resource has changed.

Internally, they are calculated using the Murmur 3 hash function (if the `mmh3`
module is available) or the MD5 hash function. Both these hash functions are
designed in a way that accidental collisions are very unlikely.

Due to the nature of hash functions, a collision can never be avoided with
absolute certainty, so version strings should only be used when the risk
associated with using an outdated resource is acceptable.

    without changing the ``ctime`` or ``mtime``. This might happen, if the
