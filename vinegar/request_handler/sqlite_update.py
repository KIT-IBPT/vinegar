"""
Request handler that allows for making changes to an SQLite database.

This request handler is backed by an instance of
`vinegar.utils.sqlite_store.DataStore` for actually accessing the database.

This can be useful when a flag for a system has to be updated dynamically. For
example, there might be a flag that indicates whether a system should boot into
an installer when booting from the network. Once the system installation has
finished, this flag would need to be reset to avoid running the installer again
and again. With this handler, this can be achieved by making a HTTP request to
an instance of this handler once the installation process has finished. This
handler can then reset the flag in the database, ensuring that the system will
not boot into the installer again.

This handler only handles ``POST`` requests. The semantics of ``GET`` requests
are that they are idempotent, meaning that they do not change any state. As
this request handler makes changes to the state of the database, allowing
``GET`` requests would violate the semantics of the HTTP protocol.

It is very easy to trigger a ``POST`` request from the command line. Depending
on which tools are available on the system, either of the following two commands
can be used::

    curl -X POST http://vinegar.example.com/sqlite-prefix/system-id
    wget -O - --post-data= http://vinegar.example.com/sqlite-prefix/system-id

When using the ``set_json_value_from_request_body`` or
``set_text_value_from_request_body`` action, the value that shall be set can be
passed like this::

    curl -X POST --data-binary myvalue \
        http://vinegar.example.com/sqlite-prefix/system-id
    wget -O - --post-data=myvalue \
        http://vinegar.example.com/sqlite-prefix/system-id

.. _access_restrictions:

Access restrictions
-------------------

By default, this request handler will allow any client to update the data for
all systems. This might not be desirable, in particular when the network in
which the Vinegar server is running cannot be deemed secure.

Therefore, it is possible to limit access to the data for each system to
specific clients. This is achieved through the ``client_address_key``
configuration option. This option specifies a key into the system data. The key
can consist of multiple components separated by colons (``:``) to point into
nested dictionary.

For example, suppose that ``client_address_key`` is set to ``net:ip_addr``. If
the handler gets a request for the system ID ``myid``, it will ask the data
source for the system data for this system by calling
``data_source.get_data('myid', {}, '')``.

If the system data returned for this system does not contain a value for the
specified key, the request is denied with HTTP status code 403 (forbidden) and
the database is not modified.

For this example, let us assume that the data source returns the following data
for the system ``myid`` (expressed as YAML):

.. code-block:: yaml

    net:
        ip_addr: 192.0.2.1

In this case, the request handler will only allow the request, if it comes from
the IP address 192.0.2.1. In all other cases, it will reject the request.

Instead of a single IP address, the system data may also contain a list or set
of IP addresses. For example, if ``get_data`` returned the following system
data

.. code-block:: yaml

    net:
        ip_addr:
            - 192.0.2.1
            - 2001:db8::1

the request would be allowed if it came from 192.0.2.1 or 2001:db8::1.

When the ``client_address_key`` option is used, this request handler needs a
data source in order to get information about the system. This request handler
implements the ``DataSourceAware`` interface, so when it is used inside a
container, that container will typically take care of setting the data source.
If instantiated directly, the data source has to be set explicitly by calling
the handler's ``set_data_source`` method.

Configuration options
---------------------

The ``sqlite_update`` request handler have several configuration options that
can be used to control its behavior.

:``action`` (mandatory):
    Action to be taken when this handler is triggers. If set to ``delete_data``,
    all data stored for the specified system is deleted. If set to
    ``delete_value``, only the key and value specified by the ``key`` option
    are deleted. If set to ``set_value`` the value for the key specified by the
    ``key`` option is set to the value specified by the ``value`` option. If set
    to ``set_json_value_from_request_body``, the value is read from the body of
    the HTTP request and decoded as JSON. If set to
    ``set_text_value_from_request_body``, the value is read from the body of the
    HTTP request (it must be encoded as UTF-8) and stored as a string.

:``db_file`` (mandatory):
    Path to the database file that contains the SQLite database that will be
    updated by this handler. This database must be a database in the format
    expected by `vinegar.utils.sqlite.data_store`.

:``request_path`` (mandatory):
    request path for which this request handler shall be used. The specified
    path must start with a ``/``. It will match any request that has a path that
    starts with the configured request path and is followed by a string. For
    example, when the ``request_path`` is set to ``/prefix`` the handler will
    match ``/prefix/name``. In this example, ``name`` is the string that is used
    as the system ID.

:``client_address_key`` (optional):
    Key into the system data that points to the place in the data where the
    allowed client address or addresses are stored. If this option is not set
    (the default), each client can access this handler for arbitrary system IDs
    and thus modify the data for arbitrary systems. When this is not desired,
    this option can be used to limit the allowe client (IP) addresses for each
    system. The key can point into a nested dictionary, using the colon (``:``)
    to separate key components for the various levels. The value can be a string
    (matching exactly one IP address) or a list or set of IP addresses (matching
    any of the addresses in the list or set). Please refer to
    :ref:`access_restrictions` for a more detailed discussion of how this option
    can be used.

:``key`` (optional):
    Name of the key in the database that shall be deleted or updated. If the
    ``action`` is set to ``delete_value``, ``set_value``,
    ``set_json_value_from_request_body``, or
    ``set_text_value_from_request_body``, this option must be specified.

:``value`` (optional):
    Value to be set for the key denoted by the ``key``. When the ``action`` is
    set to ``set_value``, this option must be specified.
