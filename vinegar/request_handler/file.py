"""
Request handler that serves files from the file systems.

The files can either be served as is or they can be processed through a
template engine. The handler can either work with a single file or with a whole
directory of files.

Optionally, this handler can supply system data from a `DataSource` when
rendering templates. In this case, the request path has to contain a piece of
information that allows for identifying the system. This can either be the
system ID, or a value that allows for looking up the system ID through the
data source's `~DataSource.find_system` method. This is configured through the
`lookup_key` configuration option.

The request handler classes provided by this module implement the
`DataSourceAware` interface in order to get access to the data source. When
using the request handlers in a container context, the container will usually
take care of injecting the data source. When using the classes directly, the
using code has to take care of that. However, a `DataSource` is only needed
when using the ``lookup_key`` configuration option. If that option is empty
(the default), no data source is needed and it is not even used if it is
available.

This module provides request handlers for both HTTP and TFTP. These two
handlers are almost identical in their behavior with only a few minor
differences:

* The options related to the ``Content-Type`` header are only available in the
  HTTP version. TFTP does not have any equivalent of the ``Content-Type``
  header in HTTP.
* The TFTP version of the handler allows request paths that do not start with a
  forward slash (``/``). In this case, the forward slash is added
  automatically. The HTTP version of the handler, in contrast, does not do
  anything like this because request paths not starting with a forward slash
  are rejected by the HTTP server component.

By default, this request handler does not process files as templates and treats
them as binary files. However, when enabling templating through the
``template`` option, files are read as text files and decoded as UTF-8. The
result of the rendering process of the template engine is then encoded as UTF-8
before sending it to the client.

This means that the default value of the ``content_type`` option (only
available in the HTTP version of the handler) depends on whether a template
engine is used or not.

.. _request_handler_file_request_path_matching:

Request path matching
---------------------

The request paths for which a handler is used are configured through its
``request_path`` option. The configured request path must always start with a
``/`` and must not end with a ``/`` (the exception being the case where the
whole path just consists of a single ``/``).

When operating in file mode (if the ``file`` configuration option is used), the
request path must be an exact match. For example, the configured request path
``/my/file`` matches the actual request path ``/my/file`` (and ``my/file`` for
TFTP), but it does not match ``/my/file/`` or ``/my/file/abc``. In file mode,
the special request path ``/`` can only be used for the HTTP version of the
handler, not the TFTP one. The reason is that TFTP has no notion of index files
and due to a missing ``/`` being added automatically, such a configuration
would actually match requests with an empty path.

When operating in directory mode (if the ``root_dir`` configuration option is
used), the configured request path specifies the prefix that must match. Extra
portions of the actual request path are treated as the path of the requested
file relative to the ``root_dir``. For example, if ``request_path`` is set to
``/myprefix`` and ``root_dir`` is set to ``/path/on/fs``, a request specifying
the path ``/myprefix/some/file`` would result in the file
``/path/on/fs/some/file`` being served.

A request handler operating in directory mode will catch all requests that
start with the specified prefix, even if the file does not actually exist. This
means that a request handler serving a more specific path prefix has to come
earlier in the chain of request handlers or it will never be asked whether it
can handle a request.

When using the ``lookup_key`` configuration option, the configured request path
has to contain exactly one placeholder. The default placeholder string is
``...``, but this can be changed through the ``lookup_value_placeholder``
configuration option.

When such a configuration is used, the placeholder marks a portion of the
request path that might be different from request to request. For example, a
configured ``request_path`` of ``/prefix/file-...`` will match an actual
request path of ``/prefix/file-abc``, ``/prefix/file-def``, etc. The
placeholder will not match an empty string, so the request path will not match
``/prefix/file-``.

The value that replaces the placeholder in the actual request path is
transformed according to the configuration set through the
``lookup_value_transform`` configuration option and then used to find a system
ID through `DataSource.find_system`. This is most useful when also using a
template engine (see :ref:`request_handler_file_templates`). If no matching
system can be found, the request file is treated as not existing (unless
``lookup_no_result_action`` is set to ``continue``).

Placeholders do not necessarily have to appear at the end of a request path.
For example, a ``request_path`` of ``/prefix/.../suffix``` will match
``/prefix/abc/suffix``

Placeholders can be used in file mode as well as in directory mode. Like
request paths that do not use place holders, the extra portion of the path will
be used as the path of the file inside the directory, when operating in
directory mode.

.. _request_handler_file_templates:

Using templates
---------------

Optionally, files served by the request handlers can be treated as templates.
This behavior is enabled by setting the ``template`` configuration option to
the name of one of the template engines supported by
`~vinegar.template.get_template_engine`. One good choice might be the ``jinja``
template engine.

If the ``lookup_key`` configuration option is also set, the request handler
provides two context objects to the template engine: The ``id`` object contains
the system ID (as a ``str``) and the ``data`` object contains the data that has
been returned from the data source's `~DataSource.get_data` method. The
``data`` object is passed as a
`~vinegar.utils.smart_dict.SmartLookupOrderedDict` to make it easier to get
nested values.

The ``data`` object is not available if the data source's ``get_data`` method
raised an exception. Usually, this will cause the template not even to be
rendered, but this can be overridden through the ``data_source_error_action``
configuration option.

If the data source's `~DataSource.find_system` method returns ``None`` and
``lookup_no_result_action`` is set to ``continue``, neither ``id`` nor ``data``
are available. The same applies if ``find_system`` raises an exception and
``lookup_no_result_action`` is set to ``continue`` and
``data_source_error_action`` is set to ``ignore`` or ``warn``.

.. _request_handler_file_config_example:

Configuration example
---------------------

In order to understand how the various configuration options work together, we
look at an example configuration (expressed in YAML):

.. code-block:: yaml

    lookup_key: 'net:mac_addr'
    lookup_no_result_action: continue
    lookup_value_transform:
        - mac_address.normalize
    request_path: '/prefix/...'
    root_dir: '/path/to/the/directory'
    template: jinja

We also assume that there is a file ``/path/to/the/directory/myconf.txt`` with
the following content:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {%- if id is not defined -%}
    This content is for systems which we do not know.
    {%- else -%}
    This system has the ID {{ id }} and the MAC address
    {{ data.get('net:mac_addr') }}.
    {%- endif -%}

When a request for ``/prefix/02-03-04-05-06-0a/myconf.txt`` arrives, the MAC
address in the URL will be extracted and normalized (the ``-`` characters will
be replaced by ``:`` and letters will be converted to upper case). The
resulting value (``02:03:04:05:06:0A``) will be used as a lookup value together
and passed to the data source's ``find_system`` method along with the lookup
key (``net:mac_addr``). Assuming that the data source can resolve this
key-value combination, the returned system ID is used in a call to ``get_data``
and both the system ID and the data are passed to the template engine when
rendering ``myconf.txt``.

As we have set the ``lookup_no_result_action`` to ``continue`` a MAC address
that is not known by the data source will not result in a "not found" error
(status code 404 in the case of HTTP). Instead, the template is rendered
without a system ID and system data, so that some default content is returned.

Configuration options
---------------------

The ``file`` request handlers have several configuration options that can be
used to control their behavior. Most of them apply both the HTTP and TFTP
handler, but some are specific to only one of the two.

For a more detailed discussion about the options controlling request path
matching, please refer to :ref:`request_handler_file_request_path_matching`.
More information about the templating mechanism can be found in
:ref:`request_handler_file_templates` and a example making use of some of the
options an be found in :ref:`request_handler_file_config_example`.

The common options are:

:``file`` (mandatory):
    Path to the file that is served by the request handler. Either this option
    or the ``root_dir`` option must be set. Both options cannot be used
    together. If this option is set, the request handler only answers requests
    that specify the exact ``request_path`` and it does not serve any other
    files.

:``request_path`` (mandatory):
    request path for which this request handler should be used. The specified
    path must start with a ``/`` and it must not end with a ``/`` (unless the
    ``/`` is the only character in the whole path). When operating in directory
    mode, the value of this option is treated as a prefix. If the
    ``lookup_key`` option is set, the specified path must contain a placeholder
    (which is configured through the ``lookup_value_placeholder`` option).
    Please refer to :ref:`request_handler_file_request_path_matching` for a
    more thorough discussion of request path matching.

:``root_dir`` (mandatory):
    Path to the directory that contains the files that are served by the
    request handler. Either this option or the ``file`` option must be set.
    Both options cannot be used together. If this option is set, the request
    handler answers all requests that specify a path that starts with the
    ``request_path``. The parts of the request path after that prefix are
    interpreted as the path of the file to be served, relative to the
    ``root_dir``.

:``data_source_error_action`` (optional):
    Action to be taken if the data source's ``find_system`` or ``get_data``
    method raises an exception. If set to ``error`` (the default), the request
    handler lets this exception bubble up, typically resulting in the exception
    being logged and an error message being returned to the client. If set to
    ``ignore`` the exception is caught and process continues without the data
    from the data source (depending on the ``lookup_no_result_action`` if
    ``find_system`` raised the exception). If set to ``warn``, the same actions
    as for the the ``ignore`` action are taken, but the exception is also
    logged.

:``lookup_key`` (optional):
    Name of the lookup key that shall be used when calling ``find_system``. If
    ``None`` or empty (the default), no system-specifc data is retrieved and
    the ``request_path`` is not expected to contain a placeholder. If set to
    the special value ``:system_id:``, the value extracted from the request
    path is not passed to ``find_system``, but used as a system ID directly.

:``lookup_no_result_action`` (optional):
    Action to be taken if no system ID can be determined. This can happen if
    ``find_system`` returns ``None`` or if it raises an exception and
    ``data_source_error_action`` is set to ``ignore`` or ``warn``. If set to
    ``continue`` the code proceeds without information about the system, so
    neither the ``id`` nor the ``data`` object are available when rendering the
    template. If set to ``not_found`` (the default), a "not found" error (error
    code 404 in the case of HTTP) os returned to the client.

:``lookup_value_placeholder`` (optional):
    Placeholder that is used for the lookup value in the ``request_path``
    option. The default placeholder is ``...``. This option has no effect
    unless ``lookup_key`` is set.

:``lookup_value_transform`` (optional):
    Transformations to be applied to the lookup value. This is a list of
    transformations that are applied to the value extracted from the request
    path and being passed to ``find_system`` or being used as a system ID
    directly. This list is passed to
    `vinegar.transform.get_transformation_chain`. If this list is empty (the
    default), no transformations are applied and the string extracted from the
    request path is used as is.

:``template`` (optional):
    name of the template engine (as a ``str``) that shall be used for rending
    the files. This name is passed to `~vinegar.template.get_template_engine`
    in order to retrieve the template engine. If empty or set to ``None`` (the
    default), templating is disabled.

:``template_config`` (optional):
    configuration for the template engine. The default is an empty dictionary
    (``{}``). This configuration is passed on to the template engine as is.

The configuration options specific to the HTTP version of the request handler
are:

:``content_type`` (optional):
    Value to use for the ``Content-Type`` header that is sent to the client.
    If ``None`` or empty (the default), the content_type is guessed based on
    the ``template`` option. If no template engine is used, the value
    ``application/octet-stream`` is used. If a template engine is used, the
    value ``text/plain; charset=UTF-8`` is used. When specifying a different
    type, the value should include a ``charset`` specification for text types.
    The output of a template engine is always encoded as ``UTF-8``, so
    typically this charset should be specified.

:``content_type_map`` (optional):
    Dictionary of filenames and file extensions to ``Content-Type``
    specifications. This option is similar to the ``content_type`` option, but
    it allows for using different values for different files served by the same
    handler. When serving a file, the handler first looks for a key that
    exactly matches the filename (without any preceding path components). If no
    such key is found, it looks for a key that matches the file extension. If
    no such key is found either, it uses the value of the ``content_type``
    option. For example, when serving the file ``/path/to/my.html``, the
    handler first looks for ``my.html`` and, if that key does not exist, tries
    ``.html``. This option can only be used in directory mode. In file mode,
    using this option does not make sense because there only is a single file
    and thus using the ``content_type`` option is simpler.
